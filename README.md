An animated maze, created for Redgate software's [coding challenge](http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/entrypage/coding-challenge).

The path is generated by a depth-first recursion algorithm, as described by [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#maze-generation), implemented in Angular.js. The maze itself is simply an HTML table element with chunky borders. The underlying model is a two-dimensional array.

Javascript's native handling of arrays is a little unusual:

            [1, 2] + [3, 4]
            #=> "1,23,4"

Fortunately [Sylvester](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/) provides a nice implementation of vectors, saving a lot of awkward, repetitive code.
